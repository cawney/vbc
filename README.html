<p>Versailles Baptist Church</p>

<p>Mission Statement:
Help people Decide, Devote and Demonstrate God&rsquo;s Love.</p>

<p>TODO:
too much stuff right now.
make the church look like a family place and a community
  Make it also look like a place where people are passionate about spreading the Word of God through missions and ministry and daily acts of kindness</p>

<p>Have the nav bar have a drop down for the different age groups and then have a landing page for each of those parts of it. Like the landing page for adults would have unday small groups, worship times, wednesday night things, and sunday night thing.</p>

<p>Make the drop down list for the age have a landing page where each preacher will talk about how awesome that section is.
Serving should have a spot for you to serve in the church, in the community and in the world (global missions). There should also be something saying that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you choose because we all have special gifts</p>

<p>My vision for the website:
I want a visitor to go to the website and feel the love that our church has for Christ. Not the love like admiration, but the love that means we are going to spread the Word of God to everyone here locally and to the ends of the Earth.</p>
