      <h2>Statement of Belief</h2>
      <h3>About God</h3>
      <p class="lead">God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe.  He has eternally existed in three persons:  the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  These three are co-equal and are one God.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 13:14; I Peter 1:2</p>
      
      <h3>About Jesus Christ</h3>
      <p class="lead">Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven’s glory and will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">Matthew 1:22,23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5; 14:10-11; Hebrews 4:14,15: I Corinthians 15:3,4; Romans 1:3,4; Acts 1:9-11; I Timothy 6:14,15; Titus 2:13</p>
      
      <h3>About the Holy Spirit</h3>
      <p class="lead">The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians, we should seek to live under His control daily.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">II Corinthians 3:17; John 14:16-17,26; 15:26-27; 16:7-11,13-14; Acts 1:8; I Corinthians 2:12; 3:16; Ephesians 1:13; Galatians 5:25</p>
   
     <h3>About the Bible</h3>
     <p class="lead">The Bible is God’s word to us. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error. </p>
     <p class="text-muted">II Timothy 3:16; 1:13; II Peter 1:20, 21; Psalm 119:105, 160; 12:6; Proverbs 30:5</p>
   
     <h3>About Salvation</h3>
     <p class="lead">Salvation is a gift from God to us. We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin’s penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his or her life by faith.
</p>
     <p class="text-muted">Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8,9; John 14:6; 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:16,18</p>
     
     <h3>About Eternal Security</h3>
     <p class="lead">Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. The grace and power of God maintain salvation, not the self-effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives us this security.</p>
     <p class="text-muted">John 10:29; 6:38-40, 44; II Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25; 10:10, 14; I Peter 1:3-5; Philippians 1:6</p>
     
     <h3>About Eternity</h3>
     <p class="lead">People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.</p>
     <p class="text-muted">John 3:16; I John 2:25; 5:11-13; Romans 6:23; Revelation 20:15; Matthew 10:28; 25:44,46</p>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <h3>What's it Like?</h3>
    <p class="lead">VBC is a “come as you” are kind of atmosphere. Right from the start you will find some friendly folks who will make you feel welcome and who you will find have many of the same concerns and struggles with life that you you have! We are diverse in age, race, economic status, and levels of spiritual depth. There is a place for you!</p>
    <h4>What do I Wear?</h4>
    <p class="lead">On a typical Sunday some people come dressed up in suits, others in business casual, and others in jeans! We believe Jesus is more concerned with the condition of your heart rather than the condition of your clothes.</p>
