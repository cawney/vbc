<pre>Here we will have a sub nav so people will be able to click right where they want to go if they want to. For example, we could have a dictionary ['What we believe', 'mission statement', 'what to expect', 'how to get here', 'brief history?']</pre>
<pre>Maybe make it wehre you have to click on the those buttons and then have it all overlay and only show the stuff you need to see.</pre>
<pre>Have a contact person... ppl see that we do bible study and missions, someone wants to know more info... who do they call? Ghost Busters?</pre>

<pre>Make a JS app that will have the map embedded where the parking spots are pre-lit and have the address of the extra parking lots. It's nice to see where they are, but they don't have a physical address it can be hard to tell where it is when you are on the streets.</pre>
